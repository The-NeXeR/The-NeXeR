# 👋 Hey there! I'm TheNeXeR

I'm a **Python enthusiast** who loves building things! 🚀 I'm diving deep into:

- 🐍 **Python** (because who doesn't love a good snake?)
- 🤖 **Telegram Bots** (automating stuff is just cool, right?)
- 🌐 **Web Development** with HTML, CSS, and JS (making the web a better place, one line at a time)

## What I’m working on 💻
- Building bots that do more than just say "Hi" 🤖
- Crafting beautiful and functional websites 🌟
- Exploring new tech to keep leveling up! 🔥

## When I'm not coding... 🎮
- You’ll find me gaming, chilling to music, or exploring the latest tech trends.

Let’s connect and build something awesome together! 💥
